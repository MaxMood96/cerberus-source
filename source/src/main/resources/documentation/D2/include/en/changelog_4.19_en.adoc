*Improvements / New features*
[square]
* [ENGINE] Submit execution from campaign, only if application environment exist. (that avoid unnecessary Errors in queue).
* [ENGINE] New reserved keyword %datalib.DATALIBNAME.value% and %datalib.DATALIBNAME.base64%. Allowing managing upload/download file by uploading files on Cerberus with no more limitation on its size.
* [ENGINE] Added CSV ignoreFirstLine boolean at datalib level.
* [ENGINE] When callService that is attached to an application, host and contextroot of the corresponding application is used (if country env of the application does not exist on the test case application, search is also made on linked environments).
* [ENGINE] New variable for system.dates. You can now for example do %system.DAY-13-d% that will return the day of month (d) of 13 days ago (DAY-13). (locale of country invariant is used)
* [ENGINE] test case dependency engine now allow to define a delay between the end of an execution and the start of the next one. That allow to execute a campaign with some testcases on day 1 and release the rest of the testcases on day 2 (after some end of day treatments has been executed)
* [ENGINE] Drag and drop now report error on Drop element and not drag when necessary.
* [ENGINE] Timeout overwrite option now also overwrite pageLoadTimeout and setScriptTimeout.
* [ENGINE] Every application environment now can have 2 secrets data that can be used for password of apikey (with %system.APP_SECRET1% and %system.APP_SECRET2%). Once application is updated with its secret data, you can't access it and data is protected during execution.
* [ENGINE] You can now disable an environment at the application level thanks to the new active checkbox available.
* [GUI] Added service call simulation feature. When editing a service, you can make calls outside a testcase context in order to control and tune the definition of the call.
* [ENGINE] Added Service REST Authorization support (Basic, API Key and Bearer).
* [ENGINE] Added actions lockDevice, unlockDevice and rotateDevice for iOS and Android application
* [GUI] Improved autocompletion adding boolean, flags and contextual element for select and switchWindow actions.
* [GUI] Improved navigation on campaign execution screen. Adding CTA on top of the screen and toggle buttons for reporting details hidden by default.
* [GUI] Both campaign and execution reporting over time now include an availability KPI based on nb and time of OK.
* [GUI] direct access to Both campaign and execution reporting over time from campaign execution and test case execution screen.
* [GUI] Testcase environment selection combo has been replaced by checkbox.
* [GUI] new parameter in order to tune the nb of row above which the report by tag will auto hide the unnecessary lines cerberus_reportbytag_nblinestotriggerautohide_int (default to 50).
* [GUI] Save datatable layout on pages no longer save the current page position.
* [GUI] Optimization of datatable loading time on execution list and queue list.
* [GUI] new refresh button on pages with datatable on order to refresh the data content without a full reload of the page.
* [GUI] new reset button on pages with datatable in order to put back the default layout view.
* [GUI] New 'Application Edit' button from testcase header, execution and campaign execution pages.
* [GUI] Homepage now display also upcoming campaign execution from scheduler (nb can be tuned by 'cerberus_homepage_nbdisplayedscheduledtag' parameter).

* [GUI] Improved TestCaseScript page so that in case of change, the rerun button allow to save the change before rerun the testcase. (testcase can be saved and rerun in 1 click)
* [GUI] Campaign execution and testcase execution can now be declared as false Negative. That can be used when the non OK resul should be considered as OK because the used was on the testcase. That declaration will force the execution to be considered as OK on Availability KPI.
* [GUI] Reports over time can now be filtered by result status (in order to focus and isolate non OK result for example)
* [GUI] Report over time display spot with bigger radius when comment or description has been entered. False Negative are surrounded with green.
* [GUI] New Impact analysis tool. You can search any text (ex: xpath or variable) across all testcases.
* [GUI] Testcase can be Linked to JIRA Issue. That will display the associated label with URL on execution page.
* [GUI] Automatic issue creation with Github and Jira connector. Any non OK execution can now create an issue and link it to the Testcase. Please check the documentation for further details
