* Screenshot preview is bigger.
* Screenshot order display on execution page correspond to the timing of its creation. #2522
* Allow multiple extraParameters on robot chrome (space seperator).
* Added %system.ROBOTSESSIONID% and %system.ROBOTPROVIDERSESSIONID% system variable.
* Allow to have optional subdata and feed cerberus_testdatalib_subdataDefaultValue parameter to defined its default value (Thanks to Promod team ;-)).
