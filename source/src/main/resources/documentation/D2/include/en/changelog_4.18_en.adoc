*Improvements / New features*
[square]
* Added status code for Logs (Menu Administration / Log Viewer).
* Size of war binary reduced by cleaning a few unnecessary maven dependencies.
* Edit Robot button is now available directly from execution page.
* MANUAL Proxy configuration is also supported (on top of NETWORKTRAFFIC).
* Copy to Clipboard button added on APIKey User screen.
* CSV file can now be downloaded from test data lib screen.
* new variable %property.PROP-0.nbrows% that returns the number of rows of a property.
* new options on actions and controls in order to force screenshot before and after it gets executed (that avoid additional takeScreenshot control)
* new options on actions and controls in order to add a wait in ms before and after it gets executed (that avoid additional wait action). This is to be used with care as Cerberus already wait for an element before interacting with it.
* new parameter cerberus_pdfcampaignreportdisplayciresult_boolean in order to hide/display the cicd information on pdf report.
* PDF Files content can now be controlled after being downloaded (text content + page numbers + pdf certificates information).
* getRobotFile action now save the files on their initial format. Those files can be manually checked and saved.
* Improved navigation between Testcase script page and execution page (step focused is kept during execution and between the 2 screens).
* Screenshot preview is now bigger.
* Screenshot order display on execution page correspond to the timing of its creation. #2522
* Allow multiple extraParameters on robot chrome (space character is used as separator).
* Added %system.ROBOTSESSIONID% and %system.ROBOTPROVIDERSESSIONID% system variable.
* Allow to have optional subdata and feed cerberus_testdatalib_subdataDefaultValue parameter to defined its default value (Thanks to Promod team ;-)).
* Make Numeric conversion more robust (ex : 'EUR 123 123.5 â‚¬' will be converted to 123123.5 before performing the control)
* More robust FTP connector (Timeout support, FTP URL can be edited preserving secrets to be modified,  more detailed and precise error messages)
* SFTP support on call service Action.
* A Property length of 0 now will take all available rows of the data (whether it is csv, internal, sql or service related). All existing properties with lengths of 0 will be changed to 1 in order to secure the behavior is unchanged.
* Value1, 2 and 3 are no longer decoded when not used. (for ex, switching condition to 'always' or 'never' no longer force you to empty parameter values that could crash during decode) fix #2038
* controls on element visible are now aligned with element present when using image recognition feature.

*Warning to be considered before applying the version (deprecated features)*
[square]
* Service /GetTestCasesV001 is no longer working. Please use /GetTestCasesV002 in stead or (even better) the /api/public/testcases/Examples/0001A endpoint.
