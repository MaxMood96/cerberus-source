* Added status code for Logs (Menu Administration / Log Viewer).
* Size of war binary reduced by cleaning a few unnecessary maven dependencies.
* Edit Robot button is available directly from execution page.
* MANUAL Proxy configuration is also supported (on top of NETWORKTRAFFIC).
* Copy to Clipboard button on APIKey User screen.
* CSV file can now be downloaded from test data lib screen.
* new variable %property.PROP-0.nbrows% that return the nb of rows of a property.
* new options on actions and controls in order to force screenshot before and after (that avoid the necessary takeScreenshot control)
* new options on actions and controls in order to add a wait in ms before and after (that avoid the necessary wait action). This is to be used with care as Cerberus already wait for an element before interacting with it.

*Warning to be considered before applying the version (deprecated features)*

* Service /GetTestCasesV001 is no longuer working. Please use /GetTestCasesV002 in stead or (even better) the /api/public/testcases/Examples/0001A endpoint.
